This is a protocol for how to add new projects to the Mayfield Plant Functional Trait Database in SQLite.

## Adding new projects

Assign a new project a 4-letter code and sequential number identifier. For example: Watering project = **WATR1**. If another watering project is added later then that project will be **WATR2**.

Next make a folder for that project labeled with the unique ID *(e.g. **WATR1**)*. Within that folder, place 2 sub-folders *'raw'* and *'clean'* (both names should be lowercase). Within the *'raw'* folder, you should place all raw data files relevant to the project as well as a *'readme.txt'* that describes where those files were originally located	in the MayfieldLab Dropbox and what data are in each. Within the *'clean'* folder, you should have the R code file used to create the cleaned data csv's as well as multiple csvs for that project structured as the following.

### List of CSVs for each project

The files must be names exactly as listed below (in all lowercase) and have the same column headings.

* projects.csv
	+ project_id = a unique integer given to that project **(PKey)**
	+ project = a text string giving a title to the project *(e.g. Survey of 12 sites along a climatic gradient)*
	+ researcher = a text string noting the head PI/researcher for the proejct
	+ email = a text string noting the current email address of head PI
	+ study_sites = a text string listing the study sites of the project, seperated by an underscore *(e.g. Bendering_Kunjin_Perenjori)*

* field_season.csv
	+ field_season_id = a unique integer given to the field season **(PKey)**
	+ project_id = **FKey** to *'projects'* table
	+ year = a 4-integer year identifying the year of the field season *(e.g. 2018)*
	+ crew = a text string listing the field crew with names separated by underscores *(e.g. JohnDwyer_ClaireWainwright)*
	+ fs_min_temp_C = the minimum temperature in degrees C for the field season
	+ fs_max_temp_C = the maximum temperature in degrees C for the field season 
	+ fs_mean_precip_mm = the mean precipitation over the field season period.

**NOTE:** where are we getting these 3 above measures from - the field, BOM, another source ? Regardless, it should be standardised. 
Also, when a field season covers several sites, are we just taking the min and max temps across all sites ? 

* site.csv
	+ site_id = unique integer for site **(PKey)**
	+ site = text string for site  name *(e.g. West Perenjori Nature Reserve)*
	+ area = area of the site (estimated is okay) *(e.g. 3)*
	+ units = units of the above estimation of site *(e.g. km2)*
	+ lat = latitude value of site
	+ long = longitude value of site
	+ max_temp_C = long term (30-yr) mean annual maximum temperature in ^o^C
	+ min_temp_C = long term (30-yr) mean annual minimum temperature in ^o^C
	+ ann_precip_mm = long term (30-yr) mean annual precipitation in mm

**NOTE:** Same as above regarding the measures of temperature and precipitation.

* treatment.csv
	+ treatment_id = unique integer for treatment **(PKey)**
	+ treatment = string text describing teatment

**NOTE:** How in depth should the treatment description be ? We should give an example. We also need to figure out how we should deal with multiple treatments at some point.

* trait_summary.csv
	+ field_season_id = **FKey** to *'field_season'* table
	+ traits = text string of traits that were collected in the field season seperated by underscore *(e.g. seedmass_sla_leafarea)*
* plot.csv
	+ plot_id = unique integer for plot **(PKey)**
	+ field_season_id = **FKey** to *'field_season'* table
	+ site_id = **FKey** to *'site'* table
	+ block = integer with block number *(if no block present fill with NULL)*
	+ plot_size_cm2 = numeric plot size in cm^2^
	+ plot_shape = text string noting shape *(e.g. circle or square)*
	+ treatment_id = FKey to 'treatment' table
	+ lat = latitude value for the plot *(if not present fill with NULL)*
	+ long = longitude value for the plot *(if not present fill with NULL)*

* individual.csv
	+ individual_id = unique integer for individual plant **(PKey)**
	+ plot_id = **FKey** to *'plot'* table
	+ species_id = **FKey** to *'species'* table

### List of potential environmental CSVs for plots

Below is a list of potential tables for various plot-level environmental characteristics.

* plant_avail_p.csv
* plant_avail_n.csv
* plant_avail_k.csv
* soil_ph.csv
* canopy_cover.csv
* per_woody_debris.csv
* per_litter.csv
* per_bareground.csv

**NOTE:** We need to make sure that all these measures are standardised across sites and projects.

#### Example environmental table
Below is an example table with column headings listed.

* plant_avail_p.csv
	+ plant_avail_p_id = unique integer for variable entry **(PKey)**
	+ plant_avail_p = text string describing the environmental variable
	+ plot_id = **FKey** to *'plot'* table
	+ soilp_kg_cm = numeric value for soil P
	+ date_collected = date sample was collected

### List of potential trait CSVs for individuals

Below is a list of potential tables for various individual-level traits.

* seed_mass.csv
* height.csv
* width.csv
* sla.csv
* leaf_area.csv
* leaf_dry_mass.csv

#### Example trait table
Below is an example table with column headings listed.

* seed_mass.csv
	+ seed_mass_id = unique integer for trait entry **(PKey)**
	+ individual_id = **FKey** to *'individual'* table
	+ seedmass_mg = numeric value of the trait
	+ date_collected = date sample was collected

## Setup of the species tables for the database

Below is the setup for the species portion of the functional trait database. This part of the database will be called through the individual plant id.

* species.csv
  	+ species_id = unique integer for species **(PKey)**
  	+ species = the specific epithet of the plant scientific name
  	+ family_id = **FKey** to *'family'* table
  	+ genus_id = **FKey** to *'genus'* table
  	+ invasive_id = **FKey** to *'invasive'* table
  	+ habit_id = **FKey** to *'habit'* table
  	+ life_form = **FKey** tp *'life_form'* table
 
* family.csv
  	+ family_id = unique integer for plant family **(PKey)**
  	+ family = text string for the plant family name

* genus.csv
 	  + genus_id = unique integer for plant genus **(PKey)**
 	  + genus = text string for the plant genus name

* invasive.csv
    + invasive_id = unique integer for native/invasive statue (either 1 or 2) **(PKey)**
    + invasive = text string for the status (native and exotic, respectively)
  
* habit.csv
    + habit_id = unique integer for habit **(PKey)**
    + habit = text string to describe the habit *(e.g. grass or forb)*

* life_form.csv
    + life_form_id = unique integer for the life form 
    + life_form = text string labelling life form *(e.g. annual or perennial)*
