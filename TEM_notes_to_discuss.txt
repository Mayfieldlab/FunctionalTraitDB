NOTES to discuss
- do we want lat/longs or UTMs for the site and plot position data?
- Field season temperature (mean field season max and min or absolute?). 
	Provide url for people to extract such data. 
- Field season precip will change with length and season of field season. 
	Should add a start and end date to the table? (approximate when don't know but list if do know)
- Do we care about the date of collection for trait?
- what are the units we want to standardize to for the traits?
- want plot size and shape in the plot table?
- create a template R file with example code for future researchers to use to create the required clean csvs
- add links about SQLite and Github to the protocol
- list what the dimensions of the csv files should be (e.g. projects.csv should be a 1X4 csv without header)
- create a pdf of all example csv file and what they should look like
- make clear in protocol what are the column headings
- for individual_id = projectcode_indiv#?
- make example queries
- make example plug & play to insert new code smoothly into the database
- make code to smoothly match species ID from BD to new data
