NOTES to discuss
- do we want lat/longs or UTMs for the site and plot position data?
- Field season temperature (mean field season max and min or absolute?). 
	Provide url for people to extract such data. 
- Field season precip will change with length and season of field season. 
	Should add a start and end date to the table? (approximate when don't know but list if do know)
- Do we care about the date of collection for trait?
- what are the units we want to standardize to for the traits?
- want plot size and shape in the plot table?
