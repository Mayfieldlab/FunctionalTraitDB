Plot level data for field season 2016 for Trace Martyn

'Plot' 			- plot number (range from 1-100)
'Class.Litt'		- percent class of litter present within the plot. Litter is defined as old, grey leaf and plant litter.
	PERCENT CLASSES
		T - 0-1% trace
		1 - 1-5%
		2 - 6-15%
		3 - 16-30%
		4 - 31-50%
		5 - 51-70%
		6 - 71+%
'Class.Bare'		- percent class of bare ground in the plot, includes rocks. 
'Class.Woody'		- percent class of woody debris in 1m radius from the center of the plot. Woody debris defined as fallen logs, sticks, and twigs.
'Per.Litt'		- percent litter (taken as the mid point of the percent range of the class (e.g. class 3 = percent 32%)
'Per.Bare'		- percent barground
'Per.Woody'		- percent woody debris in 1m radius
'Lat'			- latitude of plot WGS84 from GPS
'Long'			- longitude of plot WGS84 from GPS
'Elevation'		- elevation of plot wgs84 from GPS
'Name'			- name given to the plot (e.g. H001D100 = plot number 1 with density 100)
'Density'		- the density treatment of the plot
		100 - all invididuals present in the plot (control treatment) (60 plots)
		60  - 40% of the individuals of each species removed from the plot (20 plots)
		30  - 70% of the individuals of each species removed from the plot (20 plots)
'Block'			- block that encompasses the plot 
'Num.Indivs'		- numbe of plants/individuals in plot
'Num.Species'		- number of species in plot
'Num.Focal.Species'	- number of focal species in plot
'Focals'		- a list of the focal species (in the 4 letter code) within the plot
'Beta.Diversity'	- (incomplete as of 10.06.2017) will be beta diversity of plot within the reserve
'Soil.P'		- available phosporus (values from the AG lab at UQ) (units?)
'Soil.Water'		- percent soil water holding capacity = calculated: ((mass of wet soil - mass of dry soil)/(mass of wet soil))
'Canopy.Cover'		- percent tree/canopy cover over the plot. Images were taken with a fish eye lens, threshold applied to make the image binary black and white, and then a histogram used to calculate the nubmer of black pixels.
'UTM.Long'		- UTM of plot WGS84
'UTM.Lat'		- UTM of plot WGS84
'Dist.to.Lat.edge'	- distance to the edge of the reserve (the short, southern edge)
'Dist.to.Long.edge'	- distance to the edge of the reserve (the long, western edge)
'NOTES'			- any notes I have for the plot
