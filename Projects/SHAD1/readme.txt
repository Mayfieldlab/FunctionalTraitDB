This is the collation of 2 projects: 
 - a shade experiment run by Claire Wainwright in 2015 
 - a shade experiment run by Tom Flannagan in 2015 (Honours student)
 Plots were very close together (Perenjori site) and the same experimental treatments were applied so the data can be analysed together. 

Data collected by Claire Wainwright, Tom Flannagan and Maia Raymundo

*** Seed mass and SLA traits were taken from John's Dwyer's data and not measured directly during this project ***



## Files: 

/Wainwright_ESA2016.pdf : slides for Claire's ESA talk about some of the data that includes as diagram of the experimental design. In her words: "we created plots in which we located individuals of 8 focal in dense ("High competition" in the datasheets) neighborhoods and also located individuals growing with no competition just outside of these plots ("solos" in the datasheets). We then collected seeds from each individual (column BG in the data file I sent you, "Seedcount.extrap.integer"). Half of the plots had netting over them as a shade treatment."

/raw folder: 

/2015 data.xlsx : this looks like a rawer, uncleaned version of the field data

/2015 focal species germ and viab rates.xlsx : self-explanatory **

/2015_plant_level_data_CEW170712.csv: 'plant level data' sheet saved fron .xlsx file below (fecundity, height, and some other response variables, as well as some biotic and abiotic explanatory variables at various scales eg. nearest neighbor identity, avg. soil moisture at the plot level, etc) **
/2015 plant level data with metadata CEW170712.xlsx : metadata (as below) and a sheet with plant level data  **
/2015_plant_level_metadata_CEW170712.csv : metadata (a copy of the metadata sheet in the file above) **

/neighb_data_final_CEW170712.csv : neighborhood data for each focal individual **

/Perenjori_data_FLANAGAN_05.16.xlsx : all of Tom's data, copied from /Western Australia Coexistence/Experiments_Data/16_Shade_TomF/ 

/Soil results.xlsx
all the above were copied from Mayfield Lab/Master Data Vault/Western Australia /Shade Experiment 2016 (Wainwright_Flanagan)/Claire Wainwright/

tom_shade.csv : csv version of Perenjori_data_FLANAGAN_05.16.xlsx

most of the raw data was copied on 26/06/2017
** : was copied over on 17/07/2017 after Claire did some quality control on the data and fixed some errors in the original files. Original uncorrected fiels are still available in the Master Data Vault

Note: file names remain unchanged, except for converting white spaces to _ in .csv files (for R)
