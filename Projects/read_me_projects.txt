	DENS1: all project data + README initialised 21/06/2017 
	       ** Note: growth chamber experiment only (no field data) so can be added to database at a later date **
	FACL1: all project data + README initialised 21/06/2017 
	       ** Note: field data + growth chamber experiment **
	       starting to clean but very confused by data - waiting to hear back from Claire 23/06/2017
	LITT1: all project data + README initialised 21/06/2017
	       all blue tables (except neighborhood) and trait_summary 22/06/2017 though some info is missing (GPS coordinates, site size, max and min temps ...) 
	SHAD1: waiting on Claire to answer questions 21/06/2017
	WATR1: waiting on Claire to answer questions 21/06/2017

Trace: BEND1, HOIR1, POLL1&2, SURV1, TIME1
	BEND1: Does not have individual-level trait data - maybe future endeavor to include just composition notes. **for only 2104** all blue tables except neighborhood (see schema) completed on 15/06/2017. 
	TIME1: trait table and all blue tables except neighborhood (see schema) completed on 15/06/2017. NOTE!! Need to try and standardize trait names to stay consistent across projects.
	POLL1: data will be collected during 2017 season (no previous data)
	POLL2: emailed Loy about his honours data - will  be able to send to us late August (after field season). Does not have individual plant data.
	SURV1: data has been added the the folder and trait table and all blue tables except neighborhood (see schema) completed on 22/06/2017
