Metadata for "quadrat_scale_data_June_2017.csv"
This is a quadrat-scale dataset including ALL quadrats surveyed in 2010 (dry year) and 2011 (wet year).

year = the survey year, either 2010 or 2011
remnant = name of a discrete woodland patch within the agricultural matrix
site = a 15 x 15 m herb-dominated area within a remnant (from 2 to 6 sites per remnant)
quadrat = the number of each 30 x 30 cm quadrat within which plants were surveyed (15 randomly located quadrats per site)
yrsq = concatenation of "year", "remnant", "site" and "quadrat" (provides unique quadrat identifier)"

site.lat = the latitude of the southwestern corner of the site
site.long = the longitude of the southwestern corner of the site
quadrat.x = the x coordinate in metres for the quadrat location relative to the southwestern corner of the site
quadrat.y = the y coordinate in metres for the quadrat location relative to the southwestern corner of the site

edge = indicator variable for edge sites
woody.cover = percentage cover of woody trees and shrubs above each quadrat
sclero.litter = binary variable indicating the presence of sclerophyll leaf litter (from trees and shrubs) over all or most of the quadrat
cwd = binary variable indicating the presence of course woody debris (a log or fallen branch)
grass.litter = binary variable indicating the presence of exotic grass litter (residual leaf litter) over all or most of the quadrat
plant.avail.n = plant-available N (ammonium + nitrate) for each quadrat (mg/Kg)
plant.avail.p = plant-available P (Colwell method) for each quadrat (mg/Kg)
plant.avail.k = plant-available K (Colwell method) for each quadrat (mg/Kg)
pH = soil pH (H2O)
map = mean annual precipitation (mm), extracted from SILO
gs.tmin = mean minimum temperature (deg C) during the growing season
gs.tmax = mean maximum temperature (deg C) during the growing season


Metadata for "species_in_quadrat_scale_June_2017.csv"
This LARGE dataset includes one row for each species recorded in each quadrat. The remnant, site and quadrat identifiers correspond exactly to those in "quadrat_scale_data_June_2017.csv".

year = the survey year, either 2010 or 2011
remnant = name of a discrete woodland patch within the agricultural matrix
site = ID number of each 15 x 15 m herb-dominated area within a remnant (from 2 to 6 sites per remnant)
quadrat = ID number of each 30 x 30 cm quadrat within which plants were surveyed (15 randomly located quadrats per site)
yrsq = concatenation of "year", "remnant", "site" and "quadrat" (provides unique quadrat identifier)"

species = entire species name (with "." instead of spaces, includes some unknowns but these are rare in frequency and abundance)
count = the number of individuals of the species recorded in the quadrat
life.form = life form of the species (e.g. annual forb, annual graminoid etc.)
exotic = binary variable indicating that the species is exotic in Australia
measured.sla = specific leaf area (SLA, mm2/mg) measured on a specimen collected in the quadrat
mean.seed.mass = species-level mean seed mass
measured.height = vegetative height (mm) measured on a specimen collected in the quadrat (same specimen as SLA)
measured.width = vegetative width (mm) measured on a specimen collected in the quadrat (same specimen as SLA, only available for "core" sites in 2011)
leaf.area.for.sla = area of leaf (mm2) 
leaf.complete = indicates if the leaf was complete and can be used for leaf area (only reliable for "core" sites in 2011)
leaf.dry.mass.for.sla = leaf dry mass (mg)

Metadata for "litter_data_raw.csv" added by Isaac from John
This dataset includes the percentage of litter cover in each quadrat as determined by inspection of photographs by JMD in 2017
The quadrat and edge identifiers correspond directly to "quadrat_scale_data_June_2017.csv"

yrsq = concatenation of "year", "remnant", "site" and "quadrat" (provides unique quadrat identifier)"
edge = indicator variable for edge sites 0=interior 1=edge
litter.cover = percentage of sclerophyll litter cover in each quadrat as determined by vertical photograph
