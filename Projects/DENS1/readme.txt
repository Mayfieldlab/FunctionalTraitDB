This was a growth chamber experiment run once in 2013. 
Data was collected solely by Claire

** Add to database at a later date ** 

Still I've collected all the relevant data files here for later. 

Files:
/2012_densitydata.xlsx
/survival_data_01_08_12.xlsx

both of these were copied from Mayfield Lab/Master Data Vault/Western Australia/Wainwright/Density on 21/06/2017
They contain all the relevant data for the project

Raw data: 
/2012_densitydata.xlsx: all sheets except “Sheet1”, “Sheet2”, “Margie comp coeffs”, “Biomass output”, and “repro output”
/survivaldata_08_01_12.xlsx: All sheets
