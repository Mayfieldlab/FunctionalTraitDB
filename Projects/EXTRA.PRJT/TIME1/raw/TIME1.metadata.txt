BREIF DESCRIPTION
Within each plot ("ID" numbered H001-H100) with density 100% or control (D100) - upto 10 indiviudal ("ind") plants each of the 4 focal species ("SP") were selected and measured over multiple time periods. Plants were marked with a numbered toothpick in the plots and the same individuals were measured across time.

POLE - Podolepis lessonii (not a focal - measured once by mistake)
POCA - Podolepis cansescens
VERO - Velleia rosea
PEAI - Pentameris airoides
ARCA - Arctotheca calendinia

MEASUREMENTS INCLUDE
"buds"		- number of buds on individual
"flowers"	- number of flowers on individual
"fruits"	- number of fruit (pod/seed heads,etc.) on individual
"max.height.mm"	- max height of plant (from ground to top of plant standing as-is) in mm 
"shape.long"	- when looking down on plant from above the longest distance the plant extends (mm)
"shape.90"	- measurement 90 degrees (perpendicular) to the 'shape.long' measurement (mm)
"phen"		- phenological code
	1 - First true leaves (use only once)
	2 - Early green biomass
	3 - Peak green biomass (w.o any sign of repro structures - if plant never flower this is the last code before 12)
	4 - First buds (use only once)
	5 - Continuing buds
	6 - First flower (use only once - can have continuing buds as well)
	7 - Flowering (has continuing flowers and buds)
	8 - First fruiting (use only once - can have continuing buds/flowers)
	9 - Fruiting (has continuing fruits/buds/flowers)
	10 - First seed dispersal (use only once - can have continuing buds/fruits/flowers)
	11 - Continuing seed dispersal (can have continuing buds/fruits/flowers)
	12 - Senescence (all seed appears dispersed and plant appears dead)
"group"		- the set of focals that are in the plot (separated by periods)
	P - POCA
	PE - PEAI
	V - VERO
	A - ARCA
"num.focal"	- number of focal species in the plot
"lateral"	- mean lateral distance (average of 'shape.long' and 'shape.90') (mm)
"shape"		- mean lateral distance 'lateral' divided by height 'max.height.mm' (mm)
notes		- any notes that I have included
