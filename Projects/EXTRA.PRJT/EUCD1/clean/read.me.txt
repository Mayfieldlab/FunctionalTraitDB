\f0\fs24 \cf0 Data originally located in Mayfield lab dropbox \'97> Master Data Vault \'97> Eucalyptus Drought Project \'97> Eucalyptus_Drought\
\
Data excel spreadsheets includes:\
\
allometry_master_Trav\
 - height, stem thickness, leaf area, leaf length and leaf count of four eucalyptus species\
 - Metadata included within excel spreadsheet \
\
Dought_Exp2015_2016_Loy\
 - Master = height measurements of eucalyptus species (don\'92t know what species code used?)\
 - Sheet 1 = no data \
 - Dates = dates of weeks during experiment\
 - Conductance = Conductance, temperature, sensorCalNum\
 - Note: all units and dates provided\
\
Drought_Exp2015_Trav\
 - Sheet 1 = leaf count start (start, 2, final), height (start, final), conductance (6 measurements (time points), \'91Loy\'94 throughout spreadsheet??\
 - Prometer_Raw = conductance, temperature, and sensor data \
- Metadata included in excel spreadsheet \
\
Elmer_Euc_seedling_10_2016\
 - Allometry data = various trait measurements \
 - full_harvest_data = growth data, LDMC data, wood density, La:Sa data, \
 - euc_rgr = height data over weeks \
 - roots = root traits \
 - euc_SLA = SLA\
 - euc_WD = wood density \
 - lasa_full = sapwood area, label, count(in metadata?), leaf_area, la_sa(in meta data?)\
- transpiration = over time periods, mean transpiration, 25% water\
- randomisation = notes on how plants were arranged randomly by treatment and reps on benches \
 - euc_height = height over 8 weeks \
 - euc_basal_area = basal area measured over 8 weeks \
 - \

Questions:\
 - do each of these get their own project id? }
