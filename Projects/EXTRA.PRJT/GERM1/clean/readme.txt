\
cals for watering paper \
 - focal = species 4 letter code WA annuals \
 - resv = reserve (Perenjori or Kunjin\
 - bag marked = bag identifier?\
 - bag = different bag identifier?\
 - buried = number of seeds buried in ground \
 - recovered = how many seeds were recovered\
 - field seedling = visible seedlings that germinated in the bags whilst in the field \
 - fielded = seeds that died in the field \
 - seedtest = non-dead seeds that underwent lab germination and viability tests \
 - labseedling = seeds that germinated in lab conditions \
 - labstained = seeds that did not germinate in lab conditions but stained red in TZ solution \
 - landed = seeds that did not germinate in lab or stain red in TZ\
 - totalviability\
 - p.viable.recovered = percentage\
 - p.viable.buried = percentage\
 - p.germ.field - percentage\
 - 
\b num.fieldgerm = fieldseedling\
 - pgerm.field = num.fieldgerm/30 = percentage that germinated in the field\
 - num.deadinfieldandlab = fielddead + labdead\
 - num.recovered = recovered\
 - num.lost = 30-number recovered (number of seeds recovered from the field)\
 - num.surv.ungerm = labseedling + labstained \
 - surv.ungerm = num.surv.ungerm/(30-num.fieldgerm) = survived but didn\'92t germinate
