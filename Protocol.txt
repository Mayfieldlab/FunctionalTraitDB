### Protocol for Mayfield Lab Functional Trait Database ###
###########################################################

- Assign project a four letter code and number as a unique identifier. For example: 
	Watering project = WATR1
  If another watering project is added later then that project will be WATR2.

- Make a folder for that project labbeled with the unique ID (e.g. WATR1)

- Within that folder, place 2 sub-folder "raw" and "clean"
	Both names should be lowercase

- Within the 'raw' folder, you should place all raw data files relevent to the project
	as well as a 'readme.txt' that describes where those files were originally located
	in the MayfieldLab Dropbox and what data are in each.

- Within the 'clean' folder, you should have the R code file used to create the cleaned data csv's
	as well as multiple csvs for that project structured as the following:

######
LIST OF CSVs - the files must be named all lowercase with the exact same names and column headers as below.
	NOTE: 'PKey' indicated Primary Key and 'FKey' indicates Foreign Key relation to other tables.

projects.csv
	project_id = a unique integer given to that project (PKey)
	project = a text string giving a title to the project (e.g. Survey of 12 sites along a climatic gradient)
	researcher = a text string noting the head PI/researcher for the proejct
	email = a text string noting the current email address of head PI
	study_sites = a text string listing the study sites of the project

field_season.csv
	field_season_id = a unique integer given to the field season (PKey)
	project_id = FKey to 'projects' table
	year = a 4-integer year identifying the year of the field season (e.g. 2018)
	crew = a text string listing the field crew with names separated by underscores (e.g. JohnDwyer_ClaireWainwright)
	fs_min_temp_C = the minimum temperature in degrees C for the field season
	fs_max_temp_C = the maximum temperature in degrees C for the field season 
	fs_mean_precip_mm = the mean precipitaiton over the field season period.

site.csv
	site_id = unique integer for site (PKey)
	site = text string for site  name (e.g. West Perenjori Nature Reserve)
	area = area of the site (estimated is okay) (3)
	units = units of the above estimation of site (km2)
	lat = latitude value of site
	long = longitude value of site
	max_temp_C = long term (30-yr) mean annual maximum temperature in oC

	plot_id = unique integer for plot (PKey)
	field_season_id = FKey to 'field_season' table
	site_id = FKey to 'site' table

	treatment_id = FKey to 'treatment' table
	lat = latitude value for the plot (if not present fill with NULL)
	long = longitude value for the plot (if not present fill with NULL)

individual.csv
	individual_id = unique integer for individual plant (PKey)
	plot_id = FKey to 'plot' table
